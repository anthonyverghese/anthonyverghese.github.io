        <h4 class="center">Who am I?</h4>
        
        <p class="center light">In high school, I loved Math and Chemistry because I always preferred one answer to a problem rather than many. I found it fascinating to calculate the volume of a sphere with pencil and paper and I enjoyed starting chemical reactions in lab. I knew I wanted to be in the STEM field, but I wanted to make sure to get a job that would allow me to beneficially impact the world.</p>
        <p class="center light">I started at Cornell intending to major in Chemical Engineering because I wanted to make an impact in the renewable energy space. After a semester, though, I realized that I could change the world from my computer if I studied Computer Science. I could learn new concepts and programming languages whenever and wherever I wanted with limited restrictions, which I couldn't do with Chemical Engineering due to the need for special labs and equipment.</p>
        <p class="center light">Thus, I decided to switch my major to Computer Science and since then, I've enjoyed the privilege of being able to learn so many new things with just a computer and my brain. My goals are to learn as much as I can in this field and use software engineering to help improve the lives of others.

            <p class="light">During the pandemic, I was spending a lot of time at home, so I thought it would be a good idea to get into some sports other than just basketball. I started watching football every week and got hooked. This inspired me to create a Machine Learning algorithm to try to predict the outcomes of games each week and see if my algorithm could beat my personal guesses. I used the Tensorflow library for my machine learning code, and I scraped the data that I inputted into the algorithm using the BeautifulSoup Python library. I incorporated all of my code into a Flask app to visualize results in the browser. This project helped me truly understand the power of Machine Learning and how I can incorporate software engineering into any hobby. <a href="https://github.com/anthonyverghese/nfl-machine-learning" target="_blank">Github Repo link</a></p>

            <h5 class="center">Submissions Scenarios Website</h5>

            <p class="light">Over the summer of 2017, I interned at Booz Allen Hamilton with a team that focuses on online capital planning for 18 government agencies. I noticed that their current approach to figure out a client's needs could be improved with a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript based website that determines the client's scenario based on their answers to a series of questions. I asked my team for permission to create this website and they fortunately accepted. I significantly improved my web development skills from this project. In addition, this independent project that I was able to work on taught me to never shy away from expressing my ideas and to constantly think of improvements that can be made to everyday activities.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Resource Pathfinder Algorithm</h5>

            <p class="light">For my final project in my data structures class at Cornell, I had to create an algorithm in Java that allows an avatar to escape from a 2D maze with as much gold as possible. After trial and error with many different approaches, I was almost ready to just accept what I had even though I knew that it wasn't as optimal as it could be. However, the day before it was due, I decided to try out a couple more ideas that came to my mind, and one of them turned out great. I used Djikstra's algorithm with a min heap implementation with distance from a tile divided by the amount of gold at the tile as the values put into the heap. The algorithm worked extremely well, teaching me patience and the power of iterative improvement when coding.</p>
